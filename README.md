# INSTACART

## Instacart Basket Grocery Analysis

### Motivation
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns to enhance them.

### Objective
Perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of 2017's sales data in order to derive insights and recommend strategies for better customer segmentation.

### Context
This project was developed during Career Foundry's Data Analytics Immersion Course, exposing me to a deeper knowledge of Python and introducing relevant libraries used in Data Analytics and Data Science, such as **Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.  
All of this in the scope of a realistic project, with real data. All datasets are real and are made publicly available by Instacart, except the customers dataset that was artificially created for the purpose of this project.

### What you will find in this repository
1. **Project Management** – The project brief and a template for reporting  
2. **Data** – A note about why data is not hosted and the references to Original Data  
3. **Scripts** – All the Jupyter Notebook scripts developed throughout the project  
4. **Analysis** – All the visualizations generated for final reporting, and additional resources used during analysis  
5. **Deliverables** – The Final Report (as per *client* request, reporting was made in Excel, using the template provided)
