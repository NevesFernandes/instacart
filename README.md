# INSTACART
<h2>Instacart Basket Grocery Analysis</h2>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns to enhance them.

<h3>Objective</h3>
Perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of 2017's sales data in order to derive insights and recommend strategies for better customer segmentation.

<h3>Context</h3>
This project was developed during Career Foundry's Data Analytics Immersion Course, exposing me to a deeper knowledge of Python and introducing relevant libraries used in Data Analytics and Data Science, such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.</br>
All of this in the scope of a realistic project, with real data. All datasets are real and are made publicly available by Instacart, except the customers dataset is artificially created for the purpose of this project.
