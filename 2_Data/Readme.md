This folder is hosted here to replicate the project structure that I have offline.
Since the Data in this project requires heavy storage space, it is not hosted here.

<h4>2. Concerning prepared data:</h4>

It refers to several datasets that were created while handling the original data, including intermediate data after cleaning process, derived variables, and merging actions. I've used output formats *.csv and *.pkl, depending on memory optimization needs.</br>
As mentioned, it is not hosted here. In case you're interested to replicate them, you can make use of original data and by running the scripts in order (they build on each other) you should be able to come up with the prepared data.
